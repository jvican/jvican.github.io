I work at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/). I hack on compilers and tooling.
  
I am also the [Scala Improvement Process lead](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/sip-submission.html).

I contribute to the following projects:
  
1. [Zinc](https://github.com/sbt/zinc), the Scala incremental compiler.
2. [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt), the Scala build tool.
3. [Scala Center projects](https://github.com/scalacenter), like the Scala Platform and compiler plugins.
3. [Scalac](https://github.com/scala/scala), the Scala compiler.
