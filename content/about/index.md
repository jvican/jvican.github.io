I work at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/). I hack on tooling, primarly in compilers and build tools. My main focus is **developer productivity**.
  
I am also involved in the evolution of the Scala language as the [Scala Improvement Process lead](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/sip-submission.html).

## My work as a Scala contributor

1. [Bloop](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop), a fast compile/test server for Scala and Java.
1. [Zinc](https://github.com/sbt/zinc), the official Scala incremental compiler.
1. [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt), one of the most popular Scala build tools.
1. [Scalac](https://github.com/scala/scala), on performance improvements and language changes.

In the past, I've also been involved in many other [Scala Center
projects](https://github.com/scalacenter), like the production-ready
development of spores (a safer language feature for big data and functional
programming), various compiler plugins and macro libraries.
