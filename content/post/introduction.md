Hello, I am Jorge. I hack on Scala dev tools at the Scala Center. Read on me
[here]({{< ref "about/index.md" >}}).

In this blog I talk about computers and software. From time to time, you may
find me discussing about other fields: mathematics, game theory, behavioral
economics, literature or philosophy -- but with less likelihood.

If you like my work, spread the word. That's a good way to say thanks.

If you want to reach out to me, check the footer of this website or head
yourself to the [About]({{< ref "about/index.md">}}) page.
