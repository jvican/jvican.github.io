Hello, I am Jorge. I hack on Scala dev tools at the Scala Center.

I have started this blog post to explore passions, improve my writing skills and
talk about stuff I find interesting.

Most of the topics will be related to Computer Science and software engineering.
Others may be mathematics, behavioral economics, literature or philosophy -- who
knows.

I hope this may be useful to you. If you want to reach out to me, check the
footer of this website or head yourself to the [About]({{< ref
"about/index.md">}}) page.
