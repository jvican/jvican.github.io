      <description>Almost everyone I know enjoys clean places &amp;mdash; no smells, some order and lack of dirt. In my experience, it is difficult to come across someone that claims publicly its dislike for cleanliness.
But hygiene is a whim. In reality, most of people believe it has too high of a cost and sacrifice it. They prefer to spend their time and money on urgent goals, not niceties. This seems to explain why they only clean common spaces when the situation becomes unbearable rather than regularly, and why they prefer to delegate it to others rather than creating cleaning habits.</description>
