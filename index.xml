      <description>Hello, I am Jorge. I hack on Scala dev tools at the Scala Center. Read on me here.
In this blog I talk about computers and software. From time to time, you may find me discussing about other fields: mathematics, game theory, behavioral economics, literature or philosophy &amp;ndash; but with less likelihood.
If you like my work, spread the word. That&amp;rsquo;s a good way to say thanks.
If you want to reach out to me, check the footer of this website or head yourself to the About page.</description>
