      <title>Reduce compile times of macros and implicits</title>

      <description>Today I explain how I&amp;rsquo;ve reduced compilation times dramatically in one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for the past months. This project uses automatic typeclass derivation via Shapeless and I believe the optimizations here presented can be migrated to other Scala projects too.
My goal is to explain how I:
 identified the bottleneck of compilation; profiled the compilation time of my application; and, changed a few lines of code to get much better compile times.</description>

      <title>How often do we change our sbt builds</title>

      <description>I spend a lot of time thinking about build tools and popular setups, and what changes are more likely to impact developers positively. In one of these ramblings, one question popped up: &amp;ldquo;How often do we change our builds?&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s not easier to answer this question, data on the topic is scarce. So I challenged myself to come up with some data to satisfy my curiosity.
Next I show some of the data I collected from Scala projects using sbt, the most popular Scala build tool.</description>

      <description>I work at the Scala Center at EPFL. I hack on tooling, primarly in compilers and build tools. My main focus is developer productivity.
I am also involved in the evolution of the Scala language as the Scala Improvement Process lead.
My work as a Scala contributor  Bloop, a fast compile/test server for Scala and Java. Zinc, the official Scala incremental compiler. sbt, one of the most popular Scala build tools.</description>

      <description>Hello, I am Jorge. I hack on Scala dev tools at the Scala Center. Read on me here.
In this blog I talk about computers and software. From time to time, you may find me discussing about other fields: mathematics, game theory, behavioral economics, literature or philosophy &amp;ndash; but with less likelihood.
If you like my work, spread the word. That&amp;rsquo;s a good way to say thanks.
If you want to reach out to me, check the footer of this website or head yourself to the About page.</description>
